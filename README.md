📊 Telecom Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Demo Project
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a Machine Learning model to predict customer churn in a telecom company. Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a company's services. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive actions to retain valuable customers.

The project covers the complete ML pipeline including:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Model building

Model evaluation

Performance comparison

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Identify customers who are likely to churn.

Analyze key factors influencing churn.

Build and evaluate classification models.

Provide business insights for customer retention strategies.
